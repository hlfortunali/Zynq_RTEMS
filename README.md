# Zynq_RTEMS
RTEMS demo for zynq 7010

This project is used to record the learning procedure of RTEMS os.  


Note: The vitis project needs to add arm-rtems6 folder. The arm-rtems6 folder is the built bsp main folder.    
      After copying the folder to project, ohter folders can be deleted, except the folder "arm-rtems6/include"   
      and the folder "arm-rtems6/xilinx_zynq_zedboard/lib".    The folder is too big, so I don't upload it.
